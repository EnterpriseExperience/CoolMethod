rent a free trial number on verizon with a random credit card
and then keep redoing it over and over and generating random esim cards with verizon and verifying random roblox accounts 
for completely free and then doing it over and over with a VPN 
and the phone numbers would TOTALLY never just get shut down and you have an account all to yourself 
with a real verified phone number that you don't have to ever worry about ever again

Verizon Free Roblox VC Account Method: (use random credit cards though, because it just makes it better, trust me)

Just get a random cash app card (with a VPN, if applicable) and use it to sign up on Verizon, or, 
get a credit card for free with some online bank or something,
and then use it for Verizon, and then never pay attention to it again

:)

Free VPNs: Urban VPN Proxy (all servers for free, and free download + you can use it temporarily to just connect), ProtonVPN (if you wanna make an account for a VPN), Tunnelbear VPN (Just sign up and verify), 
Hotspot Shield VPN (kinda mid, kinda good, 50/50), Windscribe VPN (same usual deal as Hotspot Shield VPN, kinda)


(Disclaimer): Use an GMAIL (not email) generator when making the accounts and add security to the accounts, just incase something we're to happen
you would not get robbed, and another pro tip: don't just make random accounts on Roblox,
they are obviously going to rate limit you (you'll have to wait like a whole 30 min sometimes, just to make another account)
and be smart about security, because everybody wants to hack and all that
and have a braincell, without atleast a half a braincell, your not making it
you get the point, stay safe, and ill have a list to the Gmail Generators below, if you want it

Not sure how safe they are, but they are all free, they usually will include ads though
obviously, so heres the best ad blockers i've personally used to: (uBlock Origin, #1 in my opinion, blocks everything)
